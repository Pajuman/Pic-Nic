Pic Nic
A card game for 1-2 players — designed by me.


Story
Good people went out for a picnic on a sunny day.
But not everything goes as planned — some uninvited insect guests want a bite of those sweet treats too!
And so the race begins: feed your insect buddies before the other player does.


Rules
There are 3 baskets — you choose which one to throw your card into.
Card order matters — strategy is key.
If your insect lands on food, it eats it.
If a flapper lands on an insect, the insect is killed.
You can also:
  - move the top card to the bottom
  - move the bottom card to the top
  - use advanced bugs when the timing feels right:
      - Mantis — eats both food and insects.
      - Ladybug — doesn’t do much... but she’s pretty and earns bonus points.
You score points for:
  - insects that survive
  - the food they eat
    
Each of the 3 baskets is scored independently.
Winning condition: You must win 2 out of 3 baskets.
Game ends when one player runs out of cards.

History
I’ve always loved playing and designing board games.
Pic Nic started out as a real card game I designed with the hope of publishing it.
Eventually, it turned into a fun Python project.
